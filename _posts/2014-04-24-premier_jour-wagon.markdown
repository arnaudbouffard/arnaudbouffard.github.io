Last thursday, I decided on a whim to join the current Le Wagon season. For the last year I've spent some time learning about different web technologies, what each of them are used for and how they relate to each other. I now know stuff about html, css, js, coffeescript, ruby, jquery, d3.js, three.js and webGL. But I recently figured out that wasn't **enough** to build some prototypes for the different projects I am currently working on.
